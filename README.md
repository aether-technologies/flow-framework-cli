# flow-framework
The Flow Framework is custom framework based on the FBP (Flow-based Programming) paradigm. 

The idea is to allow any ES6 Javascript module that extends the Flow class to be easily and seemlessly integrated into the client-side or server-side of an application built using the Flow Framework.
